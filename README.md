# Architecture Overview
This is simple application which has golang service which reads from static dataset.
Redis is used for caching. Data is stored in redis cache for fast retrieval and it is fetched from cache directly if present, otherwise it is first stored in the cache and then returned as response.

The vue application running listens on the apiUrl continuously and displays the data in a bar graph format.
